    {
      question: "Do I need to bring a partner?",

      answer2:"It’s also a great way to build confidence and make new friends.If you come with your own partner and prefer to stay together, just let the instructor and the group know.",
    },
    {      
      question: "Which classes are best for beginners?",
      answer: "All classes marked as Level 1 are perfect for beginners. You’ll learn the fundamentals of rhythm, steps, leading and following dynamics in a supportive and fun environment.",
      answer2:"If you’ve never done partner dancing before, our beginner classes are the best place to start.",
    },
    {     
      question: "When can I start taking classes?",
      answer: "Our classes run in monthly cycles, restarting on the first week of every month.",
      answer2:"If you’d like to join mid-month, we recommend booking a private class to catch up, or waiting for the next cycle to start fresh with the group.This helps everyone progress together — so you can learn at the right pace without feeling overwhelmed or lost.",
    },
    {      
      question: "What should I wear to class?",
      answer: "Wear something comfortable that lets you move freely — think breathable clothing that allows movement and keeps you cool.",
      answer2:"Some students like to dress up a bit, others keep it casual. There is no dress code — just wear what makes you feel confident and ready to move!",
    }, 
    {      
      question: "What type of shoes should I wear?",
      answer: "You don’t need special shoes to start dancing! Clean sneakers or smooth-soled shoes work just fine.",
      answer2:"Once you start dancing more regularly, we recommend investing in dance shoes with suede soles — they make turns smoother and help protect your joints. Avoid heavy boots, flip-flops, or high stilettos — your feet will thank you later.",
    },
    {      
      question: "How many times should I take each level?",
      answer: "Every dancer progresses at their own pace. What matters most is practice and consistency, not speed.",
      answer2:"You’ll know you’re ready for the next level when you feel confident, comfortable, and can apply what you’ve learned with different partners and music tempos.",
